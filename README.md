# Binary Search Tree (BST) Project

## Overview

This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++, showcasing fundamental operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal. It is designed to provide an educational tool for understanding the mechanics of BSTs and to serve as a starting point for more complex data structure implementations.

## Features

- **Binary Search Tree Implementation:** The core of the project, defined in `BSTree.h`, includes all necessary operations of a BST.
- **Input/Output Dialogues:** `IODialog.h` provides functionalities to interact with the user, enhancing the demonstration of the BST operations.
- **Example Usage:** `main.cpp` includes a demonstration of creating a BST instance and performing various operations.

## Installation

Before you can run this project, ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. This project uses standard C++ libraries and should be compatible with C++11 compliant compilers.

1. **Download and Extract the Project**
   - If you have received this project as a ZIP file, extract it to a directory of your choice.

2. **Compilation**
   - Navigate to the project directory where `main.cpp` is located.
   - Compile the project using a C++ compiler. For example, using g++:
     ```sh
     g++ main.cpp -o BSTApp
     ```

## Running the Application

After compiling the project, you can run the application by executing the generated binary. For example, if you compiled the project with g++ as shown above:

```sh
./BSTApp
